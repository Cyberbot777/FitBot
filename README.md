# FitBot

**A fitness assistant to motivate users, create exercise plans, and suggest food plans.**

## Overview

FitBot is a fitness application designed to help users achieve their goals by providing motivational messages, personalized exercise plans, and dietary suggestions. The backend is a fully functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that leverages APIs to deliver dynamic content. The front end is planned to be developed by Jayme Hall ([GitHub](https://github.com/jaymehall)) to provide a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Motivational Messages**: Generates short, personalized motivational messages based on user goals (e.g., "weight loss," "build muscle") using OpenAI’s GPT-4 model.
- **Exercise Plans**: Creates dynamic fitness plans with 3 unique exercises tailored to the user’s equipment (e.g., "none," "dumbbell"). Exercises are generated by OpenAI, ensuring variety by avoiding overused options like push-ups and squats unless specified.
- **Food Plans**: Provides dietary suggestions based on user preferences (e.g., "vegetarian," "low carb") using the USDA FoodData Central API.
- **API-Driven Backend**: Built with FastAPI, the backend serves data via RESTful endpoints (`/motivate`, `/fitness-plan`, `/food-plan`), ready for front-end integration.
- **Secure Configuration**: Uses environment variables (via `.env`) to manage API keys securely, with `.gitignore` and VS Code settings to prevent accidental commits of sensitive files.
- **MIT License**: Open-source under the MIT License, allowing for collaboration and modification.
